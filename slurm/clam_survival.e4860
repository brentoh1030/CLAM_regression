/home/brentoh1030/miniconda3/envs/clam_latest/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/utils/data/dataloader.py:617: UserWarning: This DataLoader will create 4 worker processes in total. Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 1, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.

/home/brentoh1030/workspace/CLAM/utils/core_utils.py:350: UserWarning: The .grad attribute of a Tensor that is not a leaf Tensor is being accessed. Its .grad attribute won't be populated during autograd.backward(). If you indeed want the .grad field to be populated for a non-leaf Tensor, use .retain_grad() on the non-leaf Tensor. If you access the non-leaf Tensor by mistake, make sure you access the leaf Tensor instead. See github.com/pytorch/pytorch/pull/30531 for more informations.
